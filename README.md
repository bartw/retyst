# retyst

A React Typescript Starter.

## scripts

```shell
npm install
npm start
npm run build:dev
npm run build:prod
npm run detach
```

## about

This is a simple starter repo to quickly get a React Typescript project going.

The dev dependencies include Typescript and Webpack with ts-loader, html-webpack-plugin, webpack-cli and webpack-dev-server.

The dependencies are react, react-dom and styles-components.

I will try to keep this up to date whenever I use it (and that might be never).

## usage

You can test this repo by executing `npm install` followed by `npm start` and then browse to http://localhost:8080/.

You can use the `npm run build:dev` and `npm run build:prod` to check out the generated bundles.

The `npm run detach` script removes all connections to retyst and the github repo so you can start your own project.
